D8cards for Developers
=======================

Code: https://github.com/rajanvalecha12/d8_activity_cards/tree/master/d8cards

What Is This?
-------------

This set of modules is intended to provide working examples of Drupal 8 activity
cards.  The modules strive to be simple, well documented and
modification friendly, in order to help developers quickly learn their inner
workings.

These activities are meant to teach you about code-level development for Drupal
8. 


How To Use
-----------

There are three main ways to interact with the modules in this project:

1. Enable the modules and use them within Drupal. Not all modules will have
obvious things to see within your Drupal installation. For instance, while the
day2 will diaplay paragraph output and day3 will display form, day1 does not
have much that is visible within Drupal.

NOTE: Just download this project and place in modules folder.
